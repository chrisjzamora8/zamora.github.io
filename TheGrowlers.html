        <dt>Chinese Foundation</dt>
            <dd>Chinese Foundation is The Growlers fifth studio album. Chinese Foundation was released
                in 2014 under Everloving Records. <p><a href="http://www.undertheradarmag.com/reviews/chinese_fountain/"> Under The Radar</a> </a></a></p> who is a reputable magazine company that is known for reviewing bands
                and their albums. They are quoted saying that Chinese Foundation is "one of the best guitar albums of the year."
                They gave the album an 8/10. This album is ranked first for me because it contains the first song that I heard 
                from The Growlers, which is Black Memories. In my opinion this is not their best album, however, I rank Chinese Foundation
                first because it is the album that introduced me to my favorite band.

            <dt>Hot Tropics</dt>
            <dd>Hot Tropics is The Growlers second studio album and it was released uder Everloving Records. When it comes to 
                sound and production Hot Tropics is by far my favorite album. Although Chinese Foundation introduced me to The Growlers
                Hot Tropics was the album that introduced me to what Beach Goth entails. To me it was the standard and introduction 
                to what I should expect from The Growlers in future projects.
