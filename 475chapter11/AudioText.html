        Okay, so the album, more the extended playlist (the EP) is The Red Balloon Project by Skizzy Mars. 
        So, it is an extended playlist not an album, it is only seven songs which is a little shorter 
        than an album. It was made in preparation for his first studio album “Alone Together.” 
        That was released in 2016, in The Red Balloon the song list is: <br>
        <ul>
        <li>Like This	Skizzy Mars</li>
        <li>The City	Skizzy Mars ft. Phoebe Ryan</li>
        <li>Be Lazy	Skizzy Mars</li>
        <li>Do You There	Skizzy Mars</li>
        <li>Down	Skizzy Mars ft. G-Eazy & Devon Baldwin</li>
        <li>Time	Skizzy Mars ft. G-Eazy & Olivver the Kid</li>
        <li>To The Bottom	Skizzy Mars ft. Charlie Brand</li></ul>
        I don’t view this as the greatest, or most monumental piece of artwork, 
        it was not groundbreaking. However, it is special to me because it introduced me to what 
        alternative rap is, which is one of my favorite genres. The beats and sounds introduced me
         to alternative rock and indie music which are mmy other favorite genres. It is a little bit 
         nostalgic, back to high school, what I would listen to before soccer practice, or playing
          under the lights, or just cruising around with my friends during the summer. 
          It is nostalgic, it is just happy music, and it is something that I enjoy, and 
          I hope other people enjoy also.
